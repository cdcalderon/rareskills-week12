- Target => need to get to index 19 (25) where 'JUMPDEST' is located

The bytecode starts by pushing a very large number onto the stack. This number, which is hexadecimal `FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0`, is almost the maximum value a `256-bit` integer can hold.

Then it executes `CALLVALUE`, which gets the amount of Ether sent with the transaction and places it on the stack.

The `ADD `opcode then adds the call value to the large number. If you send 16 Ether with the transaction, the result of the addition operation will cause an integer overflow. This means the result wraps around and becomes 0 instead of exceeding the maximum value a 256-bit integer can hold.

Next, we push the number 1 onto the stack with `PUSH1` `01` and use `EQ` to check if the result of our addition is equal to 1.

If it is, we push the value 2A onto the stack `(which is the location of our JUMPDEST)` and execute `JUMPI` to jump to that location, effectively skipping the `REVERT` opcode and ending with a `STOP`, which completes the execution successfully.

However, if the result of the addition operation isn't `1`, the `EQ` check fails, and we don't make the jump. Instead, we execute `REVERT`, which halts execution and reverts all state changes.

Therefore, the solution to this puzzle is to send a transaction with a call value of `17` Ether. This way, the result of the addition operation causes an integer overflow that results in 1, allowing the `JUMPI` operation to succeed and solving the puzzle.

That's Puzzle #6! It's a great demonstration of how even basic arithmetic operations can lead to unexpected results in the world of smart contracts if not handled correctly.

Solution Input:
`{"value":17,"data":"0x"}`
