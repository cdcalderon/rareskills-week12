# Solution

The key to this puzzle is to ensure that the `SLOAD` operation, which loads from the fifth storage slot `(0x05)`, returns `0xAA`. We accomplish this by deploying a contract with `0xAA` stored at the fifth storage slot.

The runtime bytecode for this new contract is:

```assembly
00      60AA      PUSH1 AA        # Push 170 (0xAA) onto the stack
02      6005      PUSH1 05        # Push 5 onto the stack
04      55        SSTORE          # Store 170 (0xAA) at storage slot 5
```

And the construction bytecode is:

```assembly
00      6460AA600555      PUSH5 60AA600555        # Push the runtime bytecode onto the stack
06      6000              PUSH1 00                # Push 0 onto the stack
08      52                MSTORE                  # Store the runtime bytecode at memory slot 0
00      600A              PUSH1 0A                # Push 10 (0x0A) onto the stack
02      601B              PUSH1 1B                # Push 27 (0x1B) onto the stack
04      F3                RETURN                  # Return
```

When we enter the calldata `0x6460AA600555600052600A601BF3`, we deploy this new contract. The runtime bytecode of this contract is then `delegate-called`, writing `0xAA` to the fifth storage slot of the puzzle's contract. The `SLOAD` operation checks this value, and since it's the expected `0xAA`, the `EQ` comparison succeeds, enabling us to jump to the `JUMPDEST` and successfully solve the puzzle.

Solution Input:
`{"data":"0x6460AA600555600052600A601BF3","value":0}`
